**Brightly** is a library based Adafruit's `CircuitPython<https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_ Python implementation with
functions to generate simple LED patterns and animations. It is designed to work with the
`Brightly Code Generator`<http://BrightWearables.com/brightly/index.html>`_ to create an easy to use
drag-and-drop coding interface for Neopixels on CircuitPython capable boards.

Dependencies
=============
This library depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

* `Adafruit CircuitPython NeoPixel <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel/releases>`


Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============
See examples/main.py
